            Dr. David Park earned his Bachelor’s degree in Psychology with a concentration in organizational psychology and finance from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He worked in the financial services industry but despite the financial rewards, the one major thing that was lacking was a sense of fulfillment and internal reward. He ultimately left the corporate world to pursue his true passion in Physical Therapy and movement science, where he can make a difference in people's every day lives. David earned his Doctorate in Physical Therapy from Hunter College in New York City. Among the many schools of thought for patient care, David has adhered to the Functional Manual Therapy (FMT) approach through the Institute of Physical Art (IPA). David has taken extensive training through the IPA and is working towards the prestigious certification in FMT. David also obtains ongoing mentorship and is part of the team at <a href="http://www.ipanyc.com" target="_blank">IPA Manhattan Physical Therapy</a>. As an avid golfer, he is certified through the Titleist Performance Institute (TPI) to evaluate and treat golf related injuries.
